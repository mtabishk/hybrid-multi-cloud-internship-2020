# HybridMultiCloud-Task1
Hello World!

This task was on End-to-End #automation for #deploying our services on cloud service with #CDN (Content Delivery Network). I have used #awscloud #github #terraform to make this #Infrastructure as a #Code (#iaac). 

Task:

✔ Launch #ec2 instance with httpd, #git, #php and made the httpd service enabled.

✔ Creating #EBS volume and mounting it to /var/www/html.

✔ Creating Security Group for instance.

✔ Download Code from github and downloading it in /var/www/html

✔ Creating #S3 bucket and adding static content of website to it.

✔ Using cloud front make it globally available in whole world.

Thank you Vimal Daga for giving such use case to work on!👏
